# AIVA
Artificially Intelligent Virtual Assistant

This is a follow up to my ACS program. Seeing as I've changed so much already, I decided to continue under a new acronym (plus I think AIVA sounds cooler and pays testoment to AVA from Ex Machina and AIDA from Marvel's Agents of Shield).

As opposed to the ACS program, AIVA will be coded in Java with an optimized GUI and an Android App. As of now, AIVA consists of only a login window with limited functionality, however, I will be updating this repository frequently as I advance.

Updates from ACS include:

Two voices (Terminal voice and AIVA voice)
(eventually) Machine/Statistical Learning capabilities to get better at recognizing and responding to user over time.
Calibration mode for improvements over time
