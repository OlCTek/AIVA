# AIVA
Artificially Intelligent Virtual Assistant

This is a follow up to my ACS program. Seeing as I've changed so much already, I decided to continue under a new acronym (plus I think AIVA sounds cooler and pays testament to AVA from Ex Machina and AIDA from Marvel's Agents of Shield).

As opposed to the ACS program, AIVA will be coded in Java with an optimized GUI and an Android App (still in development). As of now, some functionality is missing (particularly some of the settings windows), however the prototype of the core operation is complete and can be viewed in the folders included in this repository. 

Recent updates include:
- Voice recognition
- User settings window
- User ability to control the location of the home window using "move" commands
- More streamlined animations

Updates in the works include:
- An actual voice response 
- Those dang settings windows
- A mobile app that can be linked with computer app
- Better voice recognition over time
- "Calibrate" button to calibrate for ambient sound 
- Even more streamlined animations
